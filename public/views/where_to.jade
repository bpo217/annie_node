//- The main navigation pages content is the navigation itself.  
  The whole page is a film strip.
  Each navigation box is inside the strip.
  Hover over a particular link hides the text and highlights the image.
  Clicking permanently highlights the image plays a sound,
  then scrolls the entire film strip off the page as the sound occurs.
